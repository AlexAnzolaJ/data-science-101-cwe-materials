<a name="opening"></a>
## Opening (10 mins)

> Note: Let people know where restrooms and kitchen are located, as needed.
 
- Welcome the students and find out about their interests
- Review current lesson objectives
- Check that all laptops have a Python 2.7 distribution. Anaconda is the recommended distro.
- Reference general course content or topics (e.g. code or concepts that have been used across multiple lessons)
- Include Hook / Real-world Relevance (why the content from this lesson is useful or important)

#### Instructor Bio

Welcome to Data Science 101! Here's a bit about me:
> Provide your name and brief bio, including: your background in data science, any experience you've had with GA, and one "fun fact" about yourself.

#### Introduce Yourselves

Before we dive in, a bit about you!

> Have students introduce themselves: name, what brings them to GA (ask for their current career & any specific goals), & one "fun fact".

> **Example Exercise**: *Have students write these on google doc or google poll. Instructor can briefly demonstrate data science workflow by categorizing data, merging into CSV file,  pulling out features, etc.*


#### Our Expectations

- You're ready to take charge of your learning experience.
- You've installed Anaconda & Python 2.7.
- You're curious and excited about data science!

#### Our Objectives

> Note: Write workshop objectives on board before class

- Why this topic matters (general relevance)
- Why this topic rocks (interest/hook)

> Note: Tailor these 2 points to student interests. Relate to their career info & goals students described during attendance.

## Introduction: Why Data Science? What Can Data Science Do For Me? (15 mins)

**Data Science**: A set of tools and techniques used to extract useful information from data. 

- An interdisciplinary, problem-solving oriented subject.
- The application of scientific techniques to practical problems.
- A rapidly growing field.

#### Qualities of a data scientist

- Programming skills
- Maths and Stats knowlege
- Business acumen (substantive expertise)
- Plus: Communication skills

**Check:** Insert 1-2 guiding questions to ensure students are comprehending the material.

- What is your field of expertise?
- Do you use tools such as Excel, Stata, R, Python?
- Where are you in the intersection of these skills?

> Instructor Note: The discussion for this part of the lesson can be used to prompt the students to self-assess those areas where they are stronger/weaker. This will help with creating their "Learning Plan".

#### What can data science do for me?

* Ask good questions: what is what…? …we don’t know?… we’d like to know?
* Define and test a hypothesis. Run experiments
* Scoop, scrap, sink and sample business relevant data
* Munge and wrestle data 
* Visualise data
* Understand data relationships
* Tell the machine how to learn from data
* Create data products that deliver actionable insight
* Tell relevant business stories from data

## Demo: Visualizing the Data Science Workflow (15 mins)

Walk through the steps of the Data Science Workflow. 

> Instructor Note: Make sure to emphasise that the workflow is an iterative process and not necessarily a linear one. 

Data Science Workflow:

- Acquire 
- Parse
- Filter
- Mine
- Represent
- Refine
- Interact

**Demo:** Ask the students to consider these steps in light of a real data science problem. For example: 

_"What are the leading indicators that a user will make a new online purchase?"_


**Check:** By this point, students should be able to write out specific actions related to the steps in the data science workflow.

<a name="guided-practice1"></a>
## Guided Practice: Exploring the Data Science Toolkit (20 mins)

Using a sample dataset, demonstrate how to carry out descriptive analytics using the well-known `pandas` library.

**Check:** Were students able to successfully solve the problem or complete the task?


***

<a name="ind-practice1"></a>
## Independent Practice: Analyze Some Data! (20 mins)

Use the lesson topic/skill to create a deliverable that meets certain criteria.

> Instructor Note: This can be a pair programming activity or done indpendently.

Using a second dataset, ask the students to carry out similar analysis to the one demonstrated in during the "Guided Practice"

**Check:** Were students able to create the desired deliverable(s)? Did it meet all necessary requirements / constraints?

> **BREAK** (5-10 mins)
